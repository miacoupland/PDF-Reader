# eBook Reader
A JavaFX programme to read PDF files in. The user can enter the file's source and can skip back and forth between pages, skip to a numbered page, and bookmark their current reading progress to a label on the programme and to a txt file.

The project was made because I spent so much time reading ugly PDFs in my browser for my undergraduate degree and I never really liked the format. I wanted a simpler way to read them without taking up a browser tab and making it a bit more customisable in the process. 

I used JavaFX for this project and worked with FXML for the first time. I added a CSS stylesheet to it as well to make it look slightly nicer. Colour scheme inspired by Draculatheme.
